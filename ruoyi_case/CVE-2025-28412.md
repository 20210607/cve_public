> [Attack Vectors]
> 1. Suppose an attacker is a normal user in the RuoYi system and has access to the /editSave method in SysNoticeController.
>  2. The attacker can send a request to modify system-wide notifications or announcements, which should be restricted to administrators only.
>  3. Since the application does not enforce proper authorization checks, the attacker can edit or replace official announcements, potentially spreading false information, deleting important notices, or disrupting communication within the system.
>  4. This could lead to misinformation, security policy violations, and unauthorized system modifications, causing serious security and operational risks."
