> 1. Suppose an attacker has access to the /edit/{postId} endpoint in the RuoYi system.
>  2. The attacker can modify the postId parameter and send a request to update job positions (posts) that they do not have permission to modify.
>  3. Since the application does not properly enforce authorization checks, the attacker can edit job position information that belongs to other departments or users, leading to a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability.
>  4. This could allow unauthorized users to change job titles, modify department associations, or manipulate employment records, leading to administrative confusion and security risks"

# Vulnerability PoC
In src/main/java/com/ruoyi/web/controller/system/SysPostController.java, at lines 109 and 110, within the edit method for /edit/{postId}, simply modifying the postId allows a user to edit information of other job positions. The process is as follows:
	
1.	The original job information is shown below. The user edits the first position: Chairman.

2.	Click “Edit” and intercept the request. Change the postId to 2 and forward it.

3.	It can be observed that position number 2 has moved to the end and has been changed to “test”.
